			<h1>Yuliya Birman</h1>
      			<p> Hello! Iâ€™m a graduate student in the <a href="http://biophysics.ucsf.edu/">Biophysics program</a> at UCSF. Since 2016, I have been working with <a href="https://pharm.ucsf.edu/arkin">Dr. Michelle Arkin</a>, where I am studying how the enzyme p97 helps maintain the balance of protein folding, trafficking and turnover in the cell.</p>
			<p> Before moving to San Francisco, I earned a B.S. in Chemistry at The University of Alabama, where I worked with <a href="http://pfrantom.people.ua.edu/">Dr. Patrick Frantom</a> to investigate mechanisms of functional and regulatory diversity in an enzyme superfamily. Currently, my research interests are in the areas of chemical biology and biophysics.</p>
