			<h1>Hi, I'm Yuliya!</h1>
      <p> Hello! Iâ€™m a graduate student in the Biophysics program at UCSF. Since 2016, I have been working with Dr. Michelle Arkin, where I am studying how the enzyme p97 helps regulate proteostasis, which is the balance of protein folding, trafficking and turnover in the cell. Before moving to San Francisco, I earned a B.S. in Chemistry at The University of Alabama, where I worked with Dr. Patrick Frantom to investigate mechanisms of functional and regulatory diversity in an enzyme superfamily. Currently, my research interests are in the areas of chemical biology and biophysics. </p>
			<p>I'm best known as the horrible cop from <em>A Touch of Evil</em>. Don't trust me. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
